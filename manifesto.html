            <h3>The System is Broken</h3>
            <p>We believe that the way we build infrastructure globally is fundamentally broken with most countries struggling to build and maintain their infrastructure. The modern AEC industry is suffocating under a mountain of manual and repetitive processes—from initial engineering design and project management to material sourcing.</p>
            <p>This inefficiency has a steep price: projects are becoming exponentially more complicated, costly, and perpetually delayed. We are trying to build the future with workflows designed in the past.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "It is now time to change this — by giving engineers better tools, not more tools."
            </div>

            <h3>The Trap</h3>
            <p>The tragedy is that the brightest minds in engineering and construction are massively slowed down because of the friction in the system. Instead of innovating on design and building bigger, bolder structures, engineers and construction professionals are trapped in fragmented processes—manually checking compliance codes, transferring data between incompatible software, and managing administrative overhead.</p>
            <p>They have no time for creative or ambitious work, essentially acting as human data routers, not creators.</p>

            <h3>The Solution: Orchestrated Engineering</h3>
            <p>The answer is not another "productivity tool" bolted onto broken workflows. It is a <strong>new approach</strong> to structural engineering — one where the heavy, iteration-intensive work is orchestrated end-to-end, and engineers retain full control over every decision.</p>

            <h3>Engineer in the Loop</h3>
            <p>This is how we think it should work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Platform:</strong> Handles the iteration-heavy work — geometry creation, meshing, FEA, compliance verification, and optimization loops — orchestrated in the cloud, completing in minutes what used to take hours.</li>
                <li><strong>The Engineer:</strong> Retains <strong>creative oversight and professional judgement</strong>. With repetitive iteration automated, the expert is free to focus on design decisions, safety assessment, and innovation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By separating execution from decision-making, we can deliver structural designs faster, more cost-effectively, and with greater confidence.</p>

            <h3>What This Means in Practice</h3>
            <p>We're building <strong>Polaris</strong> — a cloud-native platform that runs the full structural analysis and optimization pipeline in minutes. From geometry creation or model import through load analysis, FEA, Eurocode compliance, to calculation reports. The goal is simple: give structural engineers the leverage to do their best work, faster.</p>
